======================================================================
Standard users
--------------

You should have downloaded a tarball for the contrib, untar it, enter
the resulting directory and run

  ./configure [--fjconfig=PATH] [--prefix=...] [...]
  make
  make check   # optional
  make install


======================================================================
For users who want the latest version (and for developers)
----------------------------------------------------------

Get an svn checkout of the top-level directory
  
    svn co http://fastjet.hepforge.org/svn/contribs/trunk fjcontrib

which contains the scripts and a current list of contribs and their
versions. Within the fjcontrib directory, get the contribs themselves
by running

  ./scripts/update-contribs.sh

usually, the contribs are tagged (released) versions and there is
one svn checkout for each contrib. Then proceed with configure, make, etc.

To get updates at a later stage:

  ./scripts/update-contribs.sh               # top-level directory & all contribs
  ./scripts/update-contribs.sh  ContribName  # top-level directory & just a specific contrib

======================================================================
For developers of existing contribs
-----------------------------------

If you've followed the above instruction, switch your contrib from its
current version (usually a tag) to its trunk:

   ./scripts/update-contribs.sh ContribName trunk

[If you're savvy, you already know the svn commands for doing this;
the script just helps you with them...]

Work in ContribName/ as usual, committing your work as you go
along. When you are ready for a new release, make sure the VERSION
file contains the new version number, ChangeLog and NEWS files are all
committed, and then from the fjcontrib directory

  make check                  
  ./scripts/make-release.sh ContribName 

Then write to fastjet-contrib-librarians@hepforge.org to make that
version the default in the fastjet-contrib trunk.

======================================================================
To start a new contrib
----------------------

To get a template with all the basic files you need, run

  ./scripts/new-contrib-template.sh ContribName

This doesn't yet create anything in the fastjet contrib svn
repository, but you can already start developing it locally. 

When you're ready for version control, send a mail to 

  TO: admin@hepforge.org
  CC: fastjet-contrib-librarians@projects.hepforge.org

to get write access to the fastjet-contrib repository for you and any
co-developers. Once you have it, register your contrib in the fastjet
config svn:

  ./scripts/register-new-contrib.sh ContribName

Your ContribName directory will now point to the appropriate place in
the repository. You will still need to add the individual files inside
your contrib and commit them.

At this stage, people who check out the top-level fastjet contrib
directory will by default not see your contrib. Your co-developers can
get the trunk, by checking out the top-level directory (see above)

  ./scripts/update-contribs.sh ContribName trunk

Once you're happy with the state of your contrib, you can then make
a release with the ./scripts/make-release.sh command.
